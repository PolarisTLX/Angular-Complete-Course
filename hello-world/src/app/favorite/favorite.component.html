<span
  class="glyphicon"
  [class.glyphicon-star]="isSelected"
  [class.glyphicon-star-empty]="!isSelected"
  (click)="onClick()"

<!-- The two "isSelected have been renamed here from isFavorite" -->

<!-- When you have multiple clases for multiple conditions, can also re-write like this:
<span
class="glyphicon"
[ngClass]="{
  'glyphicon-star': isSelected,
  'glyphicon-star-empty': !isSelected
}"
(click)="onClick()"
></span> -->
